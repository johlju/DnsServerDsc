### Changed

- xDnsServer
  - Resolve style guideline violations for hashtables
  - Update pipeline files.
  - Renamed the default branch to `main` ([issue #131](https://github.com/dsccommunity/xDnsServer/issues/131)).
  - Uses `PublishPipelineArtifact` in  _Azure Pipelines_ pipeline.
  - Unit tests are now run in PowerShell 7 in the _Azure Pipelines_
    pipeline ([issue #160](https://github.com/dsccommunity/xDnsServer/issues/160)).
- xDnsRecordSrv
  - Now uses `[CimInstance]::new()` both in the resource code and the resource
    unit test to clone the existing DNS record instead of using the method
    `Clone()` that does not exist in PowerShell 7.
- xDnsServerSetting
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The mandatory parameter was replaced by the mandatory
    parameter `DnsServer`. This prevents the resource from being used twice
    in the same configuration using the same value for the parameter `DnsServer`
    ([issue #156](https://github.com/dsccommunity/xDnsServer/issues/156)).

### Removed
